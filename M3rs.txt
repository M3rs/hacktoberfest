I love open source because it is such a great way to encourage sharing and
learning. 

Other people solve problems and share their solutions, and I can do the same
thing, and we can all use eachothers shared code. 

I really love learning by digging into the source code of an open source
project that I am using, too. Something very satisfying about finding the
exact line of code that pertains to what I am looking for and just knowing.
